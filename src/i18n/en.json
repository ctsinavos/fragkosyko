    "story": {
      "p1": "Fragkosiko was born from a love of Naxos—its sun-soaked mornings, its vibrant evenings, and the way life here moves between the energy of the day and the calm of the night. We wanted to create a space that captures this rhythm, a hidden garden where locals and travelers alike can gather, relax, and savor the island's best.",
      "p2": "Tucked away in the heart of Naxos Town, our courtyard is an oasis—whitewashed walls, lush greenery, and the kind of light that shifts beautifully from morning to midnight. By day, it's the perfect spot for a leisurely brunch and a perfectly brewed coffee. By night, the space transforms into an intimate setting for cocktails, conversation, and connection.",
      "p3": "Every detail, from the seasonal menu to the thoughtfully curated drinks, reflects our commitment to celebrating local producers, traditional flavors, and the warm hospitality that Naxos is known for. We invite you to step into our garden and experience it for yourself."

      "title": "The Name \"Fragkosiko\"",

      "p2": "The prickly pear inspired not only our name but also our visual identity and flavor philosophy. You'll see its colors woven throughout our space—the soft greens of the cactus pads, the vibrant pink of the fruit, and the warm earth tones of the Cycladic landscape.",
